      <h2>Open Source Projects</h2>

      <p>
	An incomplete list of open-source projects I'm involved with:
      </p>

      <dl>
	<dt><a href="http://quixdb.github.io/squash/">Squash</a></dt>
	<dd>
	  <p>
	    Squash is primarily an abstraction layer which provides a
	    single API to access many compression libraries. This
	    allows applications a great deal of flexibility in which
	    choosing a compression algorithm, or allowing a choice
	    between several of them.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The actual integration with individual compression
	    libraries is done through plugins which can be installed
	    separately from Squash itself and are not loaded until
	    they are required. This allows Squash consumers to utilize
	    many compression algorithms without rewriting code or
	    unnecessary bloat.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In addition to a permissively licensed library, Squash
	    provides some generic tools which use the library for
	    common tasks. Currently, this includes a command-line
	    interface similar
	    to <var>gzip</var>, <var>bzip2</var>, <var>xz</var>, <i>etc.</i>
	    called <var>squash</var> and a benchmarking tool.  There
	    is also a
	    web-based <a href="https://quixdb.github.io/squash-benchmark/">benchmark</a>.
	  </p>
	</dd>

	<dt><a href="https://nemequ.github.io/munit/">µnit</a></dt>
	<dd>
	  <p>
	    µnit is a small and portable unit testing framework for C
	    which includes pretty much everything you might expect
	    from a C testing framework, plus a few pleasant surprises,
	    wrapped in a nice API.
	  </p>
	</dd>

	<dt><a href="https://nemequ.github.io/hedley/">Hedley</a></dt>
	<dd>
	  <p>
            Hedley is a C header you can include in your project to
            enable compiler specific features while maintaining
            compatibility, with a focus on making
            your <abbr>API</abbr> harder to misuse by providing hints
            to compilers and static analyzers.
          </p>
	</dd>

	<dt><a href="https://tinycthread.github.io/">TinyCThread</a></dt>
	<dd>
	  <p>
	    TinyCThread is a cross-platform implementation of the C11
	    threading API which uses POSIX or the Windows API,
	    allowing you to use the standard C11 API on systems which
	    don&#8217;t natively support it.
	  </p>
	</dd>

	<dt><a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala/">Vala</a></dt>
	<dd>
	  <p>
	    Vala is a new programming language that aims to bring
	    modern programming language features to GNOME developers
	    without imposing any additional runtime requirements and
	    without using a different ABI compared to applications and
	    libraries written in C.
	  </p>
	</dd>

	<dt><a href="https://code.google.com/p/bump/">Bump</a></dt>
	<dd>
	  <p>
	    Bump is a library designed to make asynchronous
	    programming easy by providing high-level data structures
	    for concurrency management, including multi-threading and
	    main loop callbacks, in GObject/GIO based projects,
	    especially those written in Vala.
	  </p>
	</dd>

	<dt><a href="https://code.google.com/p/sqlheavy/">SQLHeavy</a></dt>
	<dd>
	  <p>
	    SQLHeavy is a wrapper on top of SQLite with a
	    GObject-based interface, providing very nice APIs for C
	    and Vala, GObject Introspection support, and additional
	    functionality not present in SQLite.
